This means that the variable gets hoisted (memory space is set up during the creation phase) with the default value of `undefined`, until we actually get to the line where we define the variable. We haven't defined the variable yet on the line where we try to log the `name` variable, so it still holds the value of `undefined`.\n\nVariables with the `let` keyword (and `const`) are hoisted, but unlike `var`, don't get _initialized_. They are not accessible before the line we declare (initialize) them. This is called the \"temporal dead zone\". When we try to access the variables before they are declared, JavaScript throws a `ReferenceError`."

Even though we might not type them as strings, they are always converted into strings under the hood.\n\nJavaScript interprets (or unboxes) statements. When we use bracket notation, it sees the first opening bracket `[` and keeps going until it finds the closing bracket `]`. Only then, it will evaluate the statement.\n\n`mouse[bird.size]`: First it evaluates `bird.size`, which is `\"small\"`. `mouse[\"small\"]` returns `true`\n\nHowever, with dot notation, this doesn't happen. `mouse` does not have a key called `bird``, which means that `mouse.bird` is `undefined`. Then, we ask for the `size` using dot notation: `mouse.bird.size`. Since `mouse.bird` is `undefined`, we're actually asking `undefined.size`. This isn't valid, and will throw an error similar to `Cannot read property \"size\" of undefined`."
