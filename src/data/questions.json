This means that the variable gets hoisted (memory space is set up during the creation phase) with the default value of `undefined`, until we actually get to the line where we define the variable. We haven't defined the variable yet on the line where we try to log the `name` variable, so it still holds the value of `undefined`.\n\nVariables with the `let` keyword (and `const`) are hoisted, but unlike `var`, don't get _initialized_. They are not accessible before the line we declare (initialize) them. This is called the \"temporal dead zone\". When we try to access the variables before they are declared, JavaScript throws a `ReferenceError`."

Even though we might not type them as strings, they are always converted into strings under the hood.\n\nJavaScript interprets (or unboxes) statements. When we use bracket notation, it sees the first opening bracket `[` and keeps going until it finds the closing bracket `]`. Only then, it will evaluate the statement.\n\n`mouse[bird.size]`: First it evaluates `bird.size`, which is `\"small\"`. `mouse[\"small\"]` returns `true`\n\nHowever, with dot notation, this doesn't happen. `mouse` does not have a key called `bird`, which means that `mouse.bird` is `undefined`. Then, we ask for the `size` using dot notation: `mouse.bird.size`. Since `mouse.bird` is `undefined`, we're actually asking `undefined.size`. This isn't valid, and will throw an error similar to `Cannot read property \"size\" of undefined`."

This is because when you try to access a property or method on a primitive like a string, JavaScript will implicitly wrap the object using one of the wrapper classes, i.e. `String`, and then immediately discard the wrapper after the expression evaluates.

Every time a generator function encounters a `yield` keyword, the function yields the value specified after it. Note that the generator function in that case doesn’t _return_ the value, it _yields_ the value.\n\nFirst, we initialize the generator function with `i` equal to `10`. We invoke the generator function using the `next()` method. The first time we invoke the generator function, `i` is equal to `10`. It encounters the first `yield` keyword: it yields the value of `i`. The generator is now \"paused\", and `10` gets logged.\n\nThen, we invoke the function again with the `next()` method. It starts to continue where it stopped previously, still with `i` equal to `10`. Now, it encounters the next `yield` keyword, and yields `i * 2`. `i` is equal to `10`, so it returns `10 * 2`, which is `20`. This results in `10, 20`."

When we pass arguments by value, a _copy_ of that value is created (see question 46).\n\nThe variable `birthYear` has a reference to the value `\"1997\"`. The argument `year` also has a reference to the value `\"1997\"`, but it's not the same value as `birthYear` has a reference to. When we update the value of `year` by setting `year` equal to `\"1998\"`, we are only updating the value of `year`. `birthYear` is still equal to `\"1997\"`.\n\nThe value of `person` is an object. The argument `member` has a (copied) reference to the _same_ object. When we modify a property of the object `member` has a reference to, the value of `person` will also be modified, since they both have a reference to the same object. `person`'s `name` property is now equal to the value `\"Lydia\"`"

Variables declared with the `let` keyword are _block scoped_, they are only defined within the block they're declared in; the immediately-invoked function (IIFE) in this case. When we use the `typeof` operator, the operand `x` is not defined: we are trying to access `x` outside of the block it's declared in. This means that `x` is not defined. Values who haven't been assigned a value or declared are of type `\"undefined\"`. `console.log(typeof x)` returns `\"undefined\"`.\n\nHowever, we created a global variable `y` when setting `y` equal to `10`.

We don't return from the callback function, we log the accumulator and current value: `1` and `2` get logged.\n\nIf you don't return a value from a function, it returns `undefined`.

    "answer": "The value of the `this` keyword is dependent on where you use it. In a **method**, like the `getStatus` method, the `this` keyword refers to _the object that the method belongs to_. The method belongs to the `data` object, so `this` refers to the `data` object. When we log `this.status`, the `status` property on the `data` object gets logged, which is `\"🥑\"`.\n\nWith the `call` method, we can change the object to which the `this` keyword refers. In **functions**, the `this` keyword refers to the _the object that the function belongs to_. We declared the `setTimeout` function on the _global object_, so within the `setTimeout` function, the `this` keyword refers to the _global object_. On the global object, there is a variable called _status_ with the value of `\"😎\"`. When logging `this.status`, `\"😎\"` gets logged."
